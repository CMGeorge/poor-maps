Implementing a Geocoder
=======================

To implement a geocoder, you need to write two files: a JSON metadata
file and a Python file that implements a 'geocode' function.
The 'geocode' function should given a string query and bounding box
coordinates return a list of dictionaries of geocoding results, with
each dictionary having keys "title", "description", "x" and "y".
The bounding box coordinates can be used to prioritise results found in
the current view.

To download data you should always use 'poor.util.request_url' in order
to use Poor's user-agent and the default timeout from poor.conf.
See 'mapquest_nominatim' for an example, but note that you should be
able to get by with a lot less code if your geocoding service returns
less verbose results than Nominatim.
