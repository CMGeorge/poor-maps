Implementing a Geocoder
=======================

To implement a geocoder, you need to write two files: a JSON metadata
file and a Python file that implements a 'geocode' function.
The 'geocode' function should given a string query return a list of
dictionaries of geocoding results, with each dictionary having keys
"title", "description", "x" and "y".

To download data you should always use 'poor.util.request_url' in order
to use Poor's user-agent and the default timeout from poor.conf. See the
geocoders shipped with Poor for examples, but note that you should be
able to get by with a lot less code if your geocoding service returns
concise, human-readable results.
