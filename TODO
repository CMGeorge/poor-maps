 * Add auto-rotate on bearing when the Map component supports it
 * Allow landscape for the map page when gestures work right
 * Save pagestack to allow returning to geocoding or routing results
 * Allow layered tilesources (traffic, hillshade, etc.)
 * Add user interface translations (strings in QML, Python and JSON
   files as well narrative returned by routing APIs)
 * Add support for non-SI units (miles, etc.)
