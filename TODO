Poor Maps 0.5
=============

 [X] Show maneuver points along the route polyline
 [X] Keep POIs and routes across sessions
 [X] Allow removing places from history (long tap, context menu)
 [X] Add OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoder (this is mainly
     for redundancy, in case MapQuest Nominatim's servers are down,
     but also the version of Nominatim in use might differ from MapQuest)
 [X] Don't auto-center when panning or pinching
 [X] Fix partial tile loading after changing tile source
 [X] Change default GPS polling to one second
 [X] Remove viewbox arguments from geocoders
 [X] Add an about page

 FIX:
  * MapQuest Open and OSRM routers to use which Nominatim?
  * Chek cache-ability of geocoders and routers
