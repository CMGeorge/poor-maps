Poor Maps 0.5.1
===============

 [X] Work around an OSRM router bug causing it to sometimes not find
     a route at all (see http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osrm-talk/2014-June/000588.html)

Poor Maps 1.0
=============

 * Add narration of routing maneuvers
 * Save pagestack to allow returning to geocoding or routing results
 * Allow tapping on markers
 * Allow landscape for the map page when gestures work right
 * Add auto-rotate on bearing when the Map component supports it
 * Add listing nearby places (restaurants, hotels, etc.)
 * Allow layered tilesources (traffic, hillshade, etc.)
 * Add user interface translations (strings in QML, Python, JSON!)
 * Add option to prevent sleep while navigating (nemo-keepalive?)
