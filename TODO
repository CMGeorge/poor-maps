Poor Maps 0.6.1
===============

 [X] Retry geocoding or routing in case of http.BadStatusLine error,
     which probably implies a broken connection, which seems to probably
     happen when a persistent HTTP connection was made, but lost due to
     the device going to sleep
 [X] Only cache successful geocoding and routing results

Poor Maps 0.7
=============

 [ ] Improve detection of when a maneuver point has been passed
     - Narrative should disappear quicker when using car
     - Narrative should have a larger radius when using transit
       o Train/metro platform length vs. stop point
 [ ] Show all stops along a route with HSL Journey Planner
     - Non-maneuver maneuver points? compare: "continue straight"
       o i.e. passive=True field and a different icon?
