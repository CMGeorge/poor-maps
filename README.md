Poor Maps
=========

Poor Maps is an application for Sailfish OS to display tiled maps
(e.g. OpenStreetMap), places and routes with a flexible selection
of data and service providers.

Poor Maps is free software released under the GNU General Public
License (GPL), see the file `COPYING` for details.

For testing purposes you can just run
`/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmlscene qml/poor-maps.qml`.
For installation, you probably want an RPM-package; for instructions
on building that, see relevant parts from the file `RELEASING.md`.
