Poor Maps is an application for Sailfish OS to display tiled maps (e.g.
OpenStreetMap), places and routes with a flexible selection of data and
service providers.

Poor Maps is free software released under the GNU General Public License
(GPL), see the file [`COPYING`](COPYING) for details.

For testing purposes you can just run `/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmlscene
qml/poor-maps.qml`. For installation, you probably want an RPM-package;
for instructions on building that, see relevant parts from the file
[`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).
