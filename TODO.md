Poor Maps 0.24
==============

* [x] Add [Mapbox Streets GL][0.24a] and [Mapbox Outdoors GL][0.24b]
      basemaps (tile renders of the new GL styles; differ significantly
      from the previous non-GL styles, so the old ones are kept for now)
* [x] Change the default basemaps for new users to Mapbox Streets GL @2x
* [x] Update URLs of HSL basemaps
* [x] Remove Mapbox Emerald basemaps
* [x] Remove OSM Roads basemap
