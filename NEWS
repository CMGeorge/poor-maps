Poor Maps 0.6.1
===============

 * Retry geocoding or routing in case of http.client.BadStatusLine
   error, which probably implies a broken connection, which seems
   to probably happen when a persistent HTTP connection was made,
   but lost due to the device going to sleep
 * Only cache successful geocoding and routing results

Poor Maps 0.6
=============

 * Add narration of routing maneuvers
 * Default routing "From" field to current position
 * Use persistent HTTP connections for geocoding and routing too
   (this should especially speed up routing, which usually consists
   of 2-3 requests: 1-2 geocoding and 1 routing)
 * Fix HSL Journey Planner maneuver points to actually be
   on the route polyline

Poor Maps 0.5.1
===============

 * Work around an OSRM router bug causing it to sometimes not find
   a route at all (see http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osrm-talk/2014-June/000588.html)
 * Simplify MapQuest Open router paths at high zoom levels as well
 * Fix partial display of route polyline at high zoom levels

Poor Maps 0.5
=============

 * Show maneuver points along the route polyline
 * Keep POIs and routes across sessions
 * Allow removing places from history (long tap, context menu)
 * Add OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoder (this is mainly
   for redundancy, in case MapQuest Nominatim's servers are down,
   but also the version of Nominatim in use might differ)
 * Use a redundant Nominatim geocoder for MapQuest Open and OSRM routers
 * Add U-line switch in HSL Journey Planner
 * Use stock icons on menu page
 * Don't auto-center when panning or pinching
 * Fix partial tile loading after changing tile source
 * Change default GPS polling to one second
 * Remove viewbox and nmax arguments from geocoders
 * Add an about page

Poor Maps 0.4
=============

 * Add HSL Journey Planner (Helsinki Region Transport public
   transportation router, reittiopas.fi)
 * Add 'params' argument to routing functions

Poor Maps 0.3
=============

 * Add framework to support pluggable routers
 * Add MapQuest Open router (car, bicycle, pedestrian)
 * Add OSRM router (car)
 * Fix tile display when zooming to view multiple found places
 * Add 'nmax' argument to geocode functions

Poor Maps 0.2
=============

 * Add framework to support pluggable geocoders
 * Add MapQuest Nominatim geocoder
 * New icon (now matches in-app position icon)
 * Load user's own tilesources and geocoders from
   $HOME/.local/share/harbour-poor-maps instead of the previous
   $HOME/.config/harbour-poor-maps
 * Allow landscape for menu pages (the map page remains portrait only
   due to some QtLocation problem rotating gestures)
 * Bump required PyOtherSide version to 1.2 (included in Sailfish OS
   1.0.4.20 "Ohij√§rvi" released 2014-03-17)

Poor Maps 0.1
