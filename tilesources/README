Implementing a Tile Source
==========================

To implement a tile source you need to write a JSON metadata file, see
the tile sources shipped with poor for examples. Only standard 256x256
Web Mercator tiles ("format": "slippy" in the JSON file) [1] are
supported for now.

Use "~/.local/share/harbour-poor-maps/tilesources" as a local
installation directory in which to place your JSON file. Restart Poor,
and your tile source should be loaded, listed and available for use.
